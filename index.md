# Overview

This course provides an in-depth exploration of artificial intelligence, covering a range of topics from search algorithms to deep learning. 
Students will learn about informed and uninformed search algorithms, including how to evaluate their efficiency and how to choose the right algorithm for a given problem. 
They will also study genetic algorithms, which use principles of evolution to optimize solutions, and naive bayes classification, a probabilistic method for categorizing data. 
The course will delve into machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and the various algorithms used in these approaches. 
Finally, students will learn about neural networks and deep learning, including how these approaches are used to solve complex problems in fields such as image classification. 
Throughout the course, students will apply these concepts to real-world problems and learn how to evaluate the performance of their models.
