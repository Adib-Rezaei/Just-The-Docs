## Cheating 

You are cheating if:
- You copy someone else’s work from current or previous semesters.
- You have someone else’s codes in your possession and upload them as your assignment (even by mistake).
- There is a considerable similarity between the two codes (in any kind).
- Search for a code on the internet which directly leads to an assignment or homework solution.
- Co-thinking is not a problem in doing projects and exercises, but it must be done individually.

The consequence of cheating:
- **IMPORTANT**: Cheating on assignments/homework will result in receiving -100% penalty on that assignment/homework for every student involved, either source or destination.
- **IMPORTANT**: Cheating on assignments/homework for a second time or on written exams will result in a referral to the Office of Academic Affairs and failing the course.
